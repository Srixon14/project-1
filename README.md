# Strong Password Calculator

Description:
The project consists on a program that gives the user an output, which is a randomly generated word, made up of characters.

Features and Workflow:
The most basic version of the program is to return a password made up of only one letter.
Once this works, many funcionalities can be added to the program to create a stronger password. First of all, it should be able to return a longer password of a fixed given lenght. After that, the possibility to return not only letters but also numbers and symbols. Then, the lenght of the password might be variable. The next step is to give the user the possibility of getting not only one password, but as many as he wants. Finally, just to ensure the program gives a really strong password, this will have a minimum established lenght and also the program won't have the possibility of returning a password with any character repeated 4 or more times.
