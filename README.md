I would add some inputs so that the user can choose the lenght of the password and wether if he wants to add symbols, capital letters and/or numbers to it or not. Also, I would add another input to give the user the chance of getting not only one password, but as many as he wants.

Since the exercise is called 'Strong Password Generator', I would also add a condition that allows the user only to generate a minimum lenght password, for instance 8 characters. Finally, for the same reason, the password won't ever have more than, for instance, 4 times the same character.
